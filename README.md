## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation** representing connectivity between two enterprise branch locations.

The project demonstrates the design, implementation, and validation of inter-branch communication using industry-standard networking principles including routing, switching, and structured IP addressing.

This simulation was built as part of networking practice and portfolio development to reinforce real-world infrastructure concepts.
